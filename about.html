            <h2>My story</h2>
            <p>Human interactions have always fascinated me! It led me to social anthropology where I learned how to understand how culture defines people and their behaviour through research. I continued my quest for knowledge in other fields such
              as health, safety and environment and put lots of theory in to practice when working with small children in a foreign country. This experiences turned me into a solution orientated person used to everyday challenges perfecting practical
              and effective communication techniques.</p>
            <p>UX came to join all my knowledge and experience. It made everything I lived and learned up until now into a design style that is meant to help other to improve their lives. I believe in improving the world one design at the time.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I like to connect with earth by planting and gardening. I also like to energise by going to Zumba classes and photograph the simple but powerful manifestations of nature.</p>
